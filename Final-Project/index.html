          <h3 id="headline"> Aspects of Earhart's life:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Youth and training</strong> - was born in Atchison, Kansas in the home of her maternal grandfather. During the First World War, she enlisted in 1916 as a nurse's aide in the Voluntary Aid Detachment (VAD), she worked for the Toronto Red Cross.
          
            When the war was over, Amelia resumed her studies at Columbia University in New York, where she took medical preparation courses.

            In 1920, a first flight gave him the passion for flight. She became a student nurse, then, in 1925, a social worker and in the meantime, paid for flying lessons, saving enough money to buy a bright yellow biplane, which she named the Canary for this reason.

            On October 22, 1922, Earhart reached the altitude of 4,300 m, a record for an aviator at that time.

            </li>

            <li><strong>1928 transatlantic flight</strong> - Before Amelia Several had had the idea of the first flight piloted by a woman and the adventure remained risky: during the twelve months which followed, five women tried the adventure, all failed and out of the five, three disappeared purely and simply in sea. Thus Amelia was contacted, in April 1928, by Hilton Railey, collaborator of Putnam, who asked her "Would you like to be the first woman to cross the Atlantic by plane?" »

            His role during the flight was to be limited to keeping the logbook of the Fokker F.VIIb/3 “Friendship” trimotor piloted by Wilmer Stultz, himself assisted by the co-pilot and mechanic Louis Gordon.
              
            She nevertheless received a triumphal reception in England. The trio were treated to a ticker-tape parade on their return to New York Londonderry and were received at the White House by President Coolidge. Amelia was now a famous aviator.</li>

            <li><strong>Solo transatlantic flight of 1932</strong> - Fulfilling the promise she had made to herself in 1928, Earhart took off on the morning of May 20, 1932, from Harbor Grace, Newfoundland and Labrador, aboard a Lockheed Vega and after a solo flight of 14 h 56 min landed in a meadow in Culmore, north of Londonderry, Northern Ireland. She thus became the first woman to cross the Atlantic Ocean alone by plane.</li>


            <li><strong>First solo flight between Hawaii and California in 1935</strong> - On January 11, 1935, she made the very first solo flight from Hawaii to California without worry after several unsuccessful attempts by other aviators.</li>

            <li><strong>1937 world tour and disappearance</strong> - Amelia Earhart disappeared on July 2, 1937, after being last seen in Lae, Papua New Guinea as she and her navigator Fred Noonan attempted to circumnavigate the globe by the east, passing through the equator, on a twin-engine Lockheed Electra 10-E21.

            Amelia Earhart's flight was scheduled from Lae Aerodrome to Howland Island, a journey of 4,100 km. This leg was the longest in the flight plan, the length was close to the plane's range, the destination being a tiny island in a vast ocean.
            A runway had been built on tiny Howland Island, in the middle of the Pacific, to allow an essential stopover between Lae aerodrome and Hawaii, but the plane never arrived there.</li>
